I recently read an article on [Forbes: *The Future Of Software Development Is Upon Us*](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/04/18/the-future-of-software-development-is-upon-us/) and found its discussion on the future of AI in software development really interesting.  

One key point that stood out to me was their argument that **dropping AI into an already "inefficient or broken" project would do more harm than good**. I completely agree with this perspective.  

AI can only truly serve as a **tool for developers** when they already know how to code. It’s best suited for **mundane and time-consuming tasks**, not as a substitute for core coding knowledge. Otherwise, developers would have no idea how to debug code that they didn’t write or understand themselves.  

As the article pointed out:  
> Productivity only "gains in one area" if "the whole development flows at the same speed."


**Comment from plant445(Sean Tang)** I agree with Conor's take on the usage of AI tools by developers. There are many other aspects in software development for big tech besides simply writing code. For example, design documentation prior to building a piece of software often cannot be relied on AI to solve, but rather senior engineers, other team members, as well as leadership to understand how they want to drive a product and if it aligns with the tenets. However, engineers can definitely speed up the development process when it comes to more mundane tasks such as unit-testing or simple front-end changes.
