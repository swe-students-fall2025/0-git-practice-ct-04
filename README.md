I recently read an article on [Forbes: *The Future Of Software Development Is Upon Us*](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/04/18/the-future-of-software-development-is-upon-us/) and found its discussion on the future of AI in software development really interesting.  

One key point that stood out to me was their argument that **dropping AI into an already "inefficient or broken" project would do more harm than good**. I completely agree with this perspective.  

AI can only truly serve as a **tool for developers** when they already know how to code. It’s best suited for **mundane and time-consuming tasks**, not as a substitute for core coding knowledge. Otherwise, developers would have no idea how to debug code that they didn’t write or understand themselves.  

As the article pointed out:  
> Productivity only "gains in one area" if "the whole development flows at the same speed."

I recently read [Forbes: *The Future Of Software Development Is Upon Us*](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/04/18/the-future-of-software-development-is-upon-us/) and found the discussion about AI in development really interesting. One point that stood out to me is that AI works best as a **tool to assist developers**, not as a replacement for understanding the code or the system. It’s most helpful for automating repetitive tasks, but developers still need strong fundamentals to debug and make design decisions effectively. I think this is an important reminder to use AI thoughtfully, as a complement to good engineering practices.
